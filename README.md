# Brikkit Docker

Run Brikkit as a Docker image. This works both on Windows and Linux. You need to have virtualization enabled in your BIOS.

## Windows Instructions

Install Docker: if you have Windows 10 Pro, you can install Docker Desktop, otherwise, if you have Windows 10 Home, you will need to use Docker Toolbox. Ensure Docker is running properly by running `docker info` in a command line window. You should get output similar to the following:

```

If you are running Docker Toolbox, open VirtualBox, open the Settings of the default VM, go to Networking, then Advanced, then Port Forward, add the entry below, reboot your computer and make sure Docker is running as explained above.

* Name: brickadia
* Protocol: UDP
* Host IP: 0.0.0.0
* Host Port: 7777
* Guest IP:
* Guest Port: 7777

After this, download this repository and extract it somewhere (it must be inside C:\Users\<yourusername> if you use Docker Toolbox). If you are running Docker Toolbox, edit the first line of all bats to set the path to where you extracted the file. Edit brikkit.conf with your username and password. Finally, double-click build.bat and run.bat if you are using Docker Desktop, or the _toolbox versions if you are running Docker Toolbox. Your server should now be up and running and showing in the server list. Assuming you forwarded your ports, you should be able to connect (if you are on Docker Toolbox you will need to forward your ports both in VirtualBox, as explained above, and your router).

## Linux Instructions

Install Docker and confirm Docker is working properly.

Clone this repository. Then run `./build.sh` to build the docker image, and then `./run.sh` to run it.
